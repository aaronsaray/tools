# Quick and Sloppy Tools

I always end up searching quickly for a few tools here and there online, and I decided I might as well just make my own, so I can go to the same place all of the time. These are just hacked together tools to solve a problem at a time.

_Obligatory shameful request:_ If you're looking for examples of my work, please don't look at this too much - check out other repos in my github.

## Quick Reminder To Self (or other interested parties)

I'm using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to publish this on GitHub pages.

To deploy, run:

`npm run deploy`

It'll be available shortly on [the GitHub page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) then.
